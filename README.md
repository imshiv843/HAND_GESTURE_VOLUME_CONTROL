# HAND_GESTURE_VOLUME_CONTROL🎛️🖐️
A computer vision-based volume control system that allows users to adjust system volume using hand gestures. Built using OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project enables seamless interaction with your device without physical contact.

🚀 Features
✔️ Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
✔️ Gesture-based volume adjustment
✔️ Works with any webcam
✔️ Smooth and intuitive user experience

🔧 Installation

python VOLUMEHANDGESTURES.py
🛠️ How It Works
🔹 The webcam detects your hand in real-time.
🔹 It tracks your thumb and index finger positions.
🔹 The distance between the fingers controls the volume level.
🔹 Move fingers apart to increase volume, bring them closer to decrease it.
